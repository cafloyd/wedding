    content: "In Old City, Philadelphia, Caitlin successfully convinced Justin that she knew anything at all about beer, and impressed him by ordering a pumpkin ale. (She secretly hated it as soon as she tried it.) After dinner, we walked to the other end of the city in search of cocktails, talking for hours and getting to know each other along the way."

    content: "The first international border we crossed together was Canadian (and we absolutely did not begin the trip with an emergency situation involving Caitlin realizing in Buffalo that she had forgotten her passport in Philly).
